# Raptures CLI demo

Raptures aims to be a one-stop destination for managing DAOs with zero complexity. <br><br>

This is intended as a monorepo of the CLI demo of Raptures. <br><br>

Currently, we are building both an EVM version as well as a Solana version of the same.<br><br>

the scripts/ folder contains the modules such as:- <br><br>

<ol>
    <li> CLI Module (the part handling the CLI frontend)
    <li> The Solana module (the part interfacing the Solana programs)
    <li> The EVM module (the part interfacing the EVM contracts)
</ol
